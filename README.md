# @darkv/ts-general-utils

A modern, type-safe, lightweight, and tree-shakeable TypeScript utility library providing useful framework-agnostic helpers and utilities.

## Purpose

Sure, you could say 'What, yet another utility library?!', but I personally prefer a small, modern library containing the core utilities I need most often, rather than pulling in many dependencies from which I only use small parts. Most of these utilities are present in many other libraries, more or less elaborate, but especially following recent supply chain events in the npm ecosystem, it is preferable to slim down the list of dependencies.

## Features

- ⚡ **Modern** - ESM-only, built for modern JavaScript environments
- 🔒 **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with strict types
- 📦 **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, small bundle size
- 🌳 **Tree-shakeable** - Only import what you need
- 🧪 **Well-tested** - Good test coverage

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @darkv/ts-general-utils
# or
npm install @darkv/ts-general-utils
# or
